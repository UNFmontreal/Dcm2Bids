A session is all the acquisitions between the entry and exit of the participant in the scanner. You need to build a configuration file of your study to let dcm2bids associates your acquisitions through BIDS sidecar. Every study is different and this step needs a little bit of work. The scanner parameters should not change too much for one study (several MRI sessions), so a few configuration files should work. BIDS sidecar 1 files are JSON files with meta informations about the acquisition. dcm2niix (DICOM to NIfTI converter used by dcm2bids) creates automatically one BIDS sidecar for each NIfTI file. dcm2bids configuration file uses also the JSON format. One example is provided in the example folder on the github repository. It is recommended to use an editor with syntax highlighting to build a correct JSON file. Here is an online one. Command Line Interface (CLI) \u2693\ufe0e How to launch dcm2bids when you have build your configuration file ? First cd in your BIDS directory. 1 dcm2bids -d DICOM_DIR -p PARTICIPANT_ID -c CONFIG_FILE If your participant have a session ID: 1 dcm2bids -d DICOM_DIR -p PARTICIPANT_ID -s SESSION_ID -c CONFIG_FILE dcm2bids creates log files inside tmp_dcm2bids/log See dcm2bids -h or dcm2bids --help to show the help message that contains more information. Output \u2693\ufe0e dcm2bids creates a sub-<PARTICIPANT_ID> directory in the output directory (by default the folder where the script is launched). Sidecars with one matching description will be convert to BIDS. If a file already exists, dcm2bids won't overwrite it. You should use the --clobber option to overwrite files. If a description matches several sidecars, dcm2bids will add automatically the custom label run- to the filename. Sidecars with no or more than one matching descriptions are kept in tmp_dcm2bids directory. Users can review these mismatches to change the configuration file accordingly. Tools \u2693\ufe0e Helper 1 dcm2bids_helper -d DICOM_DIR [ -o OUTPUT_DIR ] To build the configuration file, you need to have a example of the sidecars.

We should see a list of compressed NIfTI files ( nii.gz ) with their resective sidecar files ( .json ). For this tutorial, we will only be interested in three acquisitions : 004_In_Axial_EPI-FMRI_(Interleaved_I_to_S)_20180918114023.nii.gz 004_In_EPI_PE=PA_20180918121230.nii.gz 003_In_EPI_PE=AP_20180918121230.nii.gz The first will be our resting state fMRI, the second and third our fieldmap EPI. When you will do it with your DICOMs, you should do it with a typical session of one of your participants. Building the configuration file \u2693\ufe0e Now we will create a configuration file called dcm2bids_config.json (this is just an example, it could be whatever we want) in the code/ folder. Use any text editor to create the file with the contents: 1 2 3 { \"descriptions\" : [] } For example, with our resting state fMRI we see in its sidecar that the field \"SeriesDescription\" is equal to \"Axial_EPI-FMRI_(Interleaved_I_to_S)\" . We can open 004_In_Axial_EPI-FMRI_(Interleaved_I_to_S)_20180918114023.json to verify that. This value could be match with a pattern \"Axial_EPI-FMRI*\" . Unfortunately, this criteria is not enough and could match other files. See 006_In_Axial_EPI-FMRI_(Interleaved_S_to_I)_20180918114023.json . In this case we could add another criteria to match the acquisition by the filename of the sidecar with the pattern \"*Interleaved_I_to_S*\" .
